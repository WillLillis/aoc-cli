## Advent of Code command-line tool üéÑ

Read [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzle descriptions, download
puzzle input, submit answers and check if they are correct, all from the
comfort of your terminal.

## Features ‚≠êÔ∏è

- Validate arguments (year, day, part) and check if puzzle is unlocked.
- Infer puzzle day when possible (last unlocked puzzle during Advent of Code
  month).
- If year is not provided, it is assumed to be the current or the last Advent of
  Code event.
- Load Advent of Code session cookie from a file.
- Save puzzle description to a file in Markdown format.
- Show the state of private leaderboards.

## Installation options üéÖ

### Compile from source

- Install a recent version of Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or update
it with:
```
# rustup update
```

`aoc-cli` relies on [openssl-sys](https://crates.io/crates/openssl-sys), which
requires OpenSSL libraries and headers for compiling it. On Linux, you need
to install a package with OpenSSL development headers such as `libssl-dev` or
`openssl-devel`.

- Install `aoc-cli` with cargo:
```
# cargo install aoc-cli
```
### Homebrew

On macOS and Linux, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
# brew install scarvalhojr/tap/aoc-cli
```

### Windows Package Manager

On Windows 10 and 11, use the
[Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)
command line tool:

```
# winget install aoc-cli
```

### Download release artifacts

Executables for selected platforms are available in
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/releases). Simply
download and extract the file. An installer is also available for Windows.

The Linux package is statically-linked with
OpenSSL and [musl C library](https://www.musl-libc.org/), and it should just
work on most Linux distributions.

The macOS and Windows packages should
automatically detect installed OpenSSL libraries. The MSVC Windows packages
require the redistributable Visual C++ runtime library, whereas the MinGW
packages require the [Minimalist GNU for Windows](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/)
runtime libraries.

## Session cookie üç™

Different Advent of Code users get different puzzle input. To download your
input and submit your answer, you need an adventofcode.com session cookie. To
obtain your session cookie, login to the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website and inspect the `session`
value of the cookie that gets stored in your browser - see instructions
[here](https://www.cookieyes.com/blog/how-to-check-cookies-on-your-website-manually).

The session cookie (a long hex string) must be provided in a single line (no
line breaks) in one of the following ways (listed in order of precedence):
1. In a file specified via the `--session-file` command line option.
2. In an `ADVENT_OF_CODE_SESSION` environment variable.
3. In a file called `.adventofcode.session` (note the dot) in your home
   directory (`/home/alice` on Linux, `C:\Users\Alice` on Windows,
   `/Users/Alice` on macOS).
4. In a file called `adventofcode.session` (no dot) in your user's config
   directory (`/home/alice/.config` on Linux, `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming`
   on Windows, `/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support` on macOS).

- Instead of `aoc submit`, type `aoc s`, `aoc su`, `aoc sub`, etc.
- Instead of `aoc private-leaderboard`, type `aoc p`, `aoc pr`, `aoc pri` etc.
